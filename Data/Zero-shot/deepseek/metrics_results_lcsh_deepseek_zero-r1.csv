making the modern primitive : cultural tourism in the trobriand islands,"this book provides an anthropological analysis of the encounter between local residents and tourists in the trobriand islands, a place renowned in anthropology and represented in various media as ""culturally authentic"" in such a place, how are ideas about authenticity implicated in creating and representing the self and cultural others in the context of cultural tourism? to answer this question, the author examines four arenas of interaction between trobriand islanders and tourists: formal performances, informal village visits, souvenir shopping, and tourist photography she employs symbolic/interpretive approaches and concepts drawn from economic anthropology to examine the relationship of tourism to the commoditization of culture, the ways in which local residents actively represent and enact ""trobriandness,"" and the ways tourists interpret and narrate their experience",heritage tourism; culture and tourism; culture; rites and ceremonies,"Photography in ethnology,Cultural tourism,Trobriand Islands (Papua New Guinea),Souvenirs (Keepsakes),Tourism,Intercultural communication,Ethnicity in art,Ethnology,Symbolic anthropology,Ethnicity,Culture,Indigenous peoples in popular culture,Group identity,Anthropology,Authenticity (Philosophy)","Photography in ethnology,Culture and tourism,Trobriand Islands (Papua New Guinea),Souvenirs (Keepsakes),Tourism,Intercultural communication,Ethnicity in art,Ethnology,Symbolic anthropology,Ethnicity,Culture,Indigenous peoples in popular culture,Group identity,Anthropology,Authenticity (Philosophy)",0.25,0.07,0.33,0.52,15.00
marriage markets : how inequality is remaking the american family,"""there was a time when the phrase ""american family"" conjured up a single, specific image: a breadwinner dad, a homemaker mom, and their 25 kids living comfortable lives in a middle-class suburb today, that image has been shattered, due in part to skyrocketing divorce rates, single parenthood, and increased out-of-wedlock births but whether it is conservatives bewailing the wages of moral decline and women's liberation, or progressives celebrating the result of women's greater freedom and changing sexual mores, most americans fail to identify the root factor driving the changes: economic inequality that is remaking the american family along class lines in marriage markets, june carbone and naomi cahn, co-authors of the acclaimed red families v blue families, examine how macroeconomic forces are transforming our most intimate and important spheres, and how working class and lower income families have paid the highest price just like health, education, and seemingly every other advantage in life, a stable two-parent home has become a luxury that only the well-off can afford the best educated and most prosperous have the most stable families, while working class families have seen the greatest increase in relationship instability why is this so? this book offers a new answer: it is due to the economics of marriage markets, and of how men and women match up when they search for a life partner for instance, when eligible (ie, desirable and marriageable) men outnumber eligible women, the marriage and marital stability rates are significantly higher than when the reverse situation occurs - the exact situation we have in america today the failure to see marriage as a market affected by supply and demand has obscured any meaningful analysis of the way that societal changes influence culture only policies that redress the balance between men and women through greater access to education, stable employment, and opportunities for social mobility can a culture that encourages commitment and investment in family life a rigorous and enlightening account of why american families have changed so much in recent decades, marriage markets cuts through the ideological and moralistic rhetoric that drives our current debate and offers real insight into-and solutions for-a problem that will haunt america for generations to come""-- provided by publisher ""june carbone and naomi cahn examine how macroeconomic forces are transforming marriage, and how working class and lower income families have paid the highest price""-- provided by publisher",families; marriage; domestic relations; equality; working class; social classes,"Single-parent families,Income distribution,Marital instability,Sex role,Mate selection,Social change,Educational mobility,Equality,United States,Social classes,Social mobility,Family policy,Divorce,Families,Unmarried mothers,Marriage","Single-parent families,Income distribution,Marital conflict,Sex role,Mate selection,Social change,Educational mobility,Equality,United States,Social classes,Social mobility,Family policy,Divorce,Families,Unmarried mothers,Marriage",0.67,0.25,0.58,0.62,16.00
