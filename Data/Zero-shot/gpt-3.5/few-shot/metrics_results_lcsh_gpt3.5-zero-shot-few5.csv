army fundamentals : from making soldiers to the limits of the military instrument,"how does an army recruit attain an identity with soldierhood? what do they give up and what do they gain? what happens when a young officer, indoctrinated in a military way of thinking, is thrust into the academic, free-thinking environment of a university? when military units are deployed in insecure environments to enhance security and governance while facilitating reconstruction and development, what separates the humanitarian from the soldier? and are the roles in fact compatible? the new zealand army is facing challenges in recruiting and retaining women - how does the anzac legend and national identity contribute to that? can a modern warrior be a woman? do nzdf personnel on deployment really 'punch above their weight' or is this a myth? what happens when our forces overseas move into policing? all these major issues are addressed in this fascinating and compelling book, in which expert authors delve deep into new zealand's modern-day armyas the foreword notes,this book delves 'into some of the seemingly idiosyncratic aspects of the new zealand army's culture, value system, enculturation practices and operational learning with vignettes, case studies, and observations that help explain military purpose, action and effect it shows how the new zealand army's traditions, practices and values seek to fit its members to cope, survive and succeed in contemporary operational settings'",soldiers; soldiers; peacekeeping forces,"military science, military education, military sociology, New Zealand.

nato missile defense and the european phased adaptive approach : the implications of burden sharing and the underappreciated role of the us army,"in 2010, nato decided to expand its ballistic missile defense program, in part because of the american offer to include its european phased adaptive approach (epaa) as the centerpiece of an expanded effort for the allies' part, few have actually contributed tangible ballistic missile defense assets, in terms of missile interceptors, radars or other sensors, or ballistic missile defense-related platforms this is likely to have significant implications for the us army, which has an important but largely underappreciated role in nato missile defense today in particular, the army is likely to face increased manpower demands, materiel requirements, and training needs in order to meet the demand signal created by the nato ballistic missile defense program additionally, army units involved directly in or in support of ballistic missile defense are likely to face a higher optempo than currently projected ultimately, this will exacerbate the perceived imbalance in transatlantic burden-sharing, particularly if the epaa provides little, if any, benefit to the defense of us territory, given washington's decision to cancel phase 4 of that framework","ballistic missile defenses; security, international; national security","North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Missile defense systems, United States.
