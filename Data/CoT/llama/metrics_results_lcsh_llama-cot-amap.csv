marriage markets : how inequality is remaking the american family,"""there was a time when the phrase ""american family"" conjured up a single, specific image: a breadwinner dad, a homemaker mom, and their 25 kids living comfortable lives in a middle-class suburb today, that image has been shattered, due in part to skyrocketing divorce rates, single parenthood, and increased out-of-wedlock births but whether it is conservatives bewailing the wages of moral decline and women's liberation, or progressives celebrating the result of women's greater freedom and changing sexual mores, most americans fail to identify the root factor driving the changes: economic inequality that is remaking the american family along class lines in marriage markets, june carbone and naomi cahn, co-authors of the acclaimed red families v blue families, examine how macroeconomic forces are transforming our most intimate and important spheres, and how working class and lower income families have paid the highest price just like health, education, and seemingly every other advantage in life, a stable two-parent home has become a luxury that only the well-off can afford the best educated and most prosperous have the most stable families, while working class families have seen the greatest increase in relationship instability why is this so? this book offers a new answer: it is due to the economics of marriage markets, and of how men and women match up when they search for a life partner for instance, when eligible (ie, desirable and marriageable) men outnumber eligible women, the marriage and marital stability rates are significantly higher than when the reverse situation occurs - the exact situation we have in america today the failure to see marriage as a market affected by supply and demand has obscured any meaningful analysis of the way that societal changes influence culture only policies that redress the balance between men and women through greater access to education, stable employment, and opportunities for social mobility can a culture that encourages commitment and investment in family life a rigorous and enlightening account of why american families have changed so much in recent decades, marriage markets cuts through the ideological and moralistic rhetoric that drives our current debate and offers real insight into-and solutions for-a problem that will haunt america for generations to come""-- provided by publisher ""june carbone and naomi cahn examine how macroeconomic forces are transforming marriage, and how working class and lower income families have paid the highest price""-- provided by publisher",families; marriage; domestic relations; equality; working class; social classes,4,"Class differences, Cultural sociology, Demography, Divorce, Economic conditions, Economic factors, Economic inequality, Economic sociology, Education, Employment, Family, Family policy, Family stability, Income distribution, Inequality, Labor market, Marriage, Marriage market, Marriage trends, Out-of-wedlock births, Population studies, Poverty, Relationship instability, Single-parent families, Social change, Social class, Social classes, Social mobility, Social stratification, Socioeconomic factors, Socioeconomic status., Sociological aspects of marriage, Stratification, Women's empowerment, Women's rights","Class size,Cultural relations,Demography,Divorce,Economic conditions,Economic aspects,Economic conditions,Social economy,Education,Employment,Family,Family policy,Single-parent families,Income distribution,Inequalities (Mathematics),Labor market,Marriage,Open marriage,Marital quality,Birth order,Population research,Poverty,Relationship addiction,Single-parent families,Social change,Social classes,Social classes,Social mobility,Social stratification,Socioeconomic status,Socioeconomic status,Marital quality,Stratification,Women's dreams,Women's rights",0.33,0.07,0.36,0.52,30.00

modern romance,"at some point, every one of us embarks on a journey to find love we meet people, date, get into and out of relationships, all with the hope of finding someone with whom we share a deep connection this seems standard now, but it's wildly different from what people did even just decades ago single people today have more romantic options than at any point in human history with technology, our abilities to connect with and sort through these options are staggering so why are so many people frustrated? some of our problems are unique to our time: ""why did this guy just text me an emoji of a pizza?"" ""should i go out with this girl even though she listed combos as one of her favorite snack foods? combos?!""

usually described as ""code-switches"" by linguists, fragments of other languages have wandered into american literature in english from the beginning wanderwords asks what, in the memoirs, poems, essays, and fiction of a variety of twentieth and twenty first century writers, the function and meaning of such language migration might be it shows what there is to be gained if we learn to read migrant writing with an eye, and an ear, for linguistic difference and it concludes that, freighted with the other-cultural meanings wrapped up in their different looks and sounds, wanderwords can perform wonders of poetic signification as well as cultural critique bringing together literary and cultural theory with linguistics as well as the theory and history of migration, and with psychoanalysis for its understanding of the multilingual unconscious, wanderwords engages closely with the work of well-known and unheard-of writers such as mary antin and eva hoffman, richard rodriguez and junot di;az, theresa hak kyung cha and bharati mukherjee, edward bok and truus van bruinessen, susana chávez-silverman and gustavo perez-firmat, pietro didonato and don delillo in so doing, a poetics of multilingualism unfolds that stretches well beyond translation into the lingual contact zone of english-with-other-languages that is american literature, belatedly re-connecting with the world""-- provided by publisher ""post-poststructuralism and psychoanalysis, and in an era of global migration in which english is the lingua franca but not necessarily the lingua aesthetica for migrants, readers and critics are more aware than ever that words and meanings wander, that writers cannot be taken at their word, and that the borders between literary forms (fiction, poetry, life-writing, essays) often do not hold what happens, then, with writers who work in english but have more than one language at their disposal? do their words wander from one language, one life, one self, one literary form to another; do the psychic and cultural worlds of their languages split apart or merge? does their english betray the presence of another language, is that other language erased, or does it appear here and there, on special occasions with special meanings? what, in different forms of literature, is the aesthetic effect of such wandering, splitting, or merging? how do writers negotiate their representation of a multilingual world for a monolingual audience?

feasibility of using mycoherbicides for controlling illicit drug crops,"""the control of illicit-drug trafficking and drug use is a difficult and complex process that involves a variety of prevention, control, treatment, and law enforcement strategies eradication strategies for controlling illicit-drug crops are used to target the beginning of the drug-supply chain by preventing or reducing crop yields mycoherbicides have been proposed as an eradication tool to supplement the current methods of herbicide spraying, mechanical removal, and manual destruction of illicit-drug crops some people regard them as preferable to chemical herbicides for controlling illicit-drug crops because of their purported specificity to only one plant species or a few closely related species as living microorganisms, they have the potential to provide long-term control if they can persist in the environment and affect later plantings research on mycoherbicides against illicit-drug crops has focused on three pathogens: fusarium oxysporum fsp cannabis for cannabis (cannabis sativa), f oxysporum fsp erythroxyli for coca (erythroxylum coca and e novogranatense), and crivellia papaveracea or brachycladium papaveris (formerly known as pleospora papaveracea and dendryphion penicillatum, respectively) for opium poppy (papaver somniferum) feasibility of using mycoherbicides for controlling illicit drug crops addresses issues about the potential use of the proposed mycoherbicides: their effectiveness in eradicating their target plants; the feasibility of their large-scale industrial manufacture and delivery; their potential spread and persistence in the environment; their pathogenicity and toxicity to nontarget organisms, including other plants, fungi, animals, and humans; their potential for mutation and resulting effects on target plants and nontarget organisms; and research and development needs on the basis of its review, the report concludes that the available data are insufficient to determine the effectiveness of the specific fungi proposed as mycoherbicides to combat illicit-drug crops or to determine their potential effects on nontarget plants, microorganisms, animals, humans, or the environment however, the committee offers an assessment of what can and cannot be determined at the present time regarding each of the issues raised in the statement of task""--publisher's description",biological pest control agents; agricultural pests; fungi as biological pest control agents; drug control,3,"Agricultural pests, Alternative crop control methods, Biological, Biological control of weeds, Cannabis, Cannabis eradication, Cannabis sativa, Coca (plant), Coca eradication, Drug policy, Drug trafficking, Environmentally friendly pest control, Eradication of illicit drugs, Erythroxylum, Erythroxylum coca, Erythroxylum novogranatense, Forestry and land use, Fungal diseases of plants, Fungi as biological control agents, Herbicides, Illicit drug crops, Invasive species, Latin America, Mycoherbicides, Opium poppy, Opium poppy eradication, Papaver somniferum, Plant diseases, Plant pathogenic fungi, Plant pathogens, Plant protection, South America, Sustainable agriculture, Weed control methods, Weed management","Agricultural pests,Crop improvement,Biologicals,Weeds as feed,Cannabis,Marijuana abuse,Cannabis,Coca,Coca,Drug legalization,Drug control,Pest control,Drug legalization,Erythroxylum,Erythroxylum,Erythroxylum,Forestry efficiency,Fungal diseases of plants,Fungi as biological pest control agents,Herbicides,Cash crops,Invasive plants,Latin America,Thiobacillus thiooxidans,Opium poppy,Opium poppy,Papaipema,Plant diseases,Fungal diseases of plants,Plant-pathogen relationships,Plants, Protection of,South America,Sustainable agriculture,Weed control,Weed control",0.75,0.11,0.77,0.51,28.00
