evolving ourselves : how unnatural selection and nonrandom mutation are changing life on earth,"in evolving ourselves, futurist juan enriquez and scientist steve gullans conduct a sweeping tour of how humans are changing the course of evolution--sometimes intentionally, sometimes not for example: globally, rates of obesity in humans nearly doubled between 1980 and 2014 what's more, there's evidence that other species, from pasture-fed horses to lab animals to house cats, are also getting fatter as reported by us government agencies, the rate of autism rose by 131 percent from 2001 to 2010, an increase that cannot be attributed simply to increases in diagnosis rates three hundred years ago, almost no one with a serious nut allergy lived long enough to reproduce today, despite an environment in which food allergies have increased by 50 percent in just over a decade, 17 million americans who suffer from food allergies survive, thrive, and pass their genes and behaviors on to the next generation in the pre-twinkie era, early humans had quite healthy mouths as we began cooking, bathing, and using antibiotics, the bacteria in our bodies changed dramatically and became far less diverse today the consequences are evident not only in our teeth but throughout our bodies and minds-- source other than library of congress though these harbingers of change are deeply unsettling, the authors argue that we are also in an epoch of tremendous opportunity new advances in biotechnology help us mitigate the cruel forces of natural selection, from saving prematurely born babies to gene therapies for sickle cell anemia and other conditions as technology enables us to take control of our genes, we will be able to alter our own species and many others--a good thing, given that our eventual survival will require space travel and colonization, enabled by a fundamental redesign of our bodies future humans could become great caretakers of the planet, as well as a more diverse, more resilient, gentler, and more intelligent species--but only if we make the right choices now-- source other than library of congress",human evolution; natural selection,"Biotechnology,Human evolution,Biotechnology applications,Genetic therapy,Epigenetics,Personalized medicine,Gene editing,Evolutionary medicine,Genetic engineering","Biotechnology,Human evolution,Biotechnology projects,Gene therapy,Epigenetics,Precision medicine,Gene editing,Evolutionary medicine,Genetic engineering",0.50,0.11,0.33,0.39,9.00
